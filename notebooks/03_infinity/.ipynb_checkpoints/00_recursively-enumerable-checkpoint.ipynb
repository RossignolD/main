    "But what exactly is the difference between the two, and do all sets fall into one of the two categories?\n",
    "This unit covers how the cardinality of sets can be compared with *bijections*, and we will see that our intuitions about infinity can be very misleading.\n",
    "For example, did you know that the set of natural numbers has the same cardinality as the set of even natural numbers?\n",

    "\n",
    "In previous units various properties of functions have been mentioned, though sometimes only in passing.\n",
    "A function is *total* iff it is defined for every elements in its domain, otherwise it is *partial*.\n",
    "The bag-of-words model and local grammars are examples of total functions.\n",
    "In addition, a function $f: A \\rightarrow B$ is *injective* iff for every $b \\in B$ there is at most one $a \\in A$ such that $f(a) = b$.\n",
    "We briefly mentioned injective functions in the comparison of sets and tuples: requiring a tuple to contain every element at most once, like a set, is the same as forcing the tuple function to be injective.\n",
    "Finally, we saw that a function $f: A \\rightarrow B$ is *onto* iff $\\range(f) = B$ - every element in the co-domain is hit by the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative term for *onto* is *surjective*, and this highlights that there is a connection between being injective and onto.\n",
    "Whereas injectivity requires that for every $b \\in B$ there is **at most one** $a \\in A$ such that $f(a) = b$, surjectivity requires that there is **at least one** such $a$.\n",
    "The two are flipsides of each other.\n",
    "But they are not incompatibel: if for every $b \\in B$ there is **exactly one** $a \\in A$ such that $f(a) = b$, then $f$ is both injective and surjective.\n",
    "In this case $f$ is called *one-to-one*, *bijective* or a *bijection* (in case you're wondering, there are no analogues nouns *injection* and *surjection*).\n",
