- relations (basic orders)

# Posets

While sets are unstructured, they can be combined with an ordering relation to yield a structured object.

\begin{definition}
A **partially ordered set**, or simple **poset**, is a pair $\tuple{S, R}$ such that $S$ is some set and $R \subseteq S \times S$ is a weak partial order over $S$.
\end{definition}

Sometimes, $S$ is also called the **carrier** of the poset $\tuple{S, R}$.
