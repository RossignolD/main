## Exercise 1

- *fr* is a bigram, because it contains exactly two sounds that occur next to each other in the word.
- *z* is not a bigram, because it contains one sound, and not two.
- *doci* is not a bigram because it contains 4 sounds, and not two. These sounds are [d], [o], [ʃ], and [ɪ].
- *pail* is not a bigram of the word, because it does not occur anywhere in the word.
- *sit* is not a bigram of the word, because it does not pccur anywhere in the word.
- *co* is a bigram, but it is not a bigram of the word, because it does not occur anywhere in the word.
- *super* is not a bigram because it contains 5 sounds, and not two. These sounds are [s], [u], [p], [ɚ]].

## Exercise 2

- *fr* is a bigram, because it contains exactly two sounds that occur next to each other in the word.
- *z* is not a bigram of the word, first because it has only one sound, and second because it does not occur anywhere in the word.
- {{{L}}}{{{R}}} is not a bigram of the word, because it does not occur anywhere in the word.
- {{{L}}}*s* is a bigram of the word. It is the first bigram in the word.
- *s* {{{R}}}{{{R}}} is not a bigram because it contains too many sounds/symbols. It contains 3 sounds/symbols, and a bigram only contains 2.

## Exercise 3

- This looks like it could be a trigram, because it contains 3 sounds/symbols. However, it is not a trigram of the word, because even though the word contains *fr*, this bigram is not at the edge of the word.
- *z* is not any one of these choices, first because it has only one sound, and second because it does not occur anywhere in the word.
- *do*{{{R}}}*c* is not any one of these choices, because it does not occur anywhere in the word.
- *s*{{{R}}}{{{{R}}}}{{{{R}}}} is a 4-gram of the word, because the sound [s] is found at the right edge of the word, and there are 3 right edge markers, making a total of 4 sounds/symbols.
- *sit* is not any of these choices, because it does not occur anywhere in the word.
- *cious* is a trigram of the word becuase it contains [ʃ], [ə] and [s].
- {{{L}}}*sup* is a 4-gram because it has 4 sounds/symbols, and it occurs in the word.

## Exercise 4

A negative 3--gram grammar for this language could be the following:
{*afa, *afu, *ufa, *ufu, *asa, *asu, *usa, *ufu}
