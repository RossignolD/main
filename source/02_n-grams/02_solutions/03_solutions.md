## Exercise 1
- The negative 3-gram grammar that describes intervocalic voicing for this set of sounds is {*afa, *afi, *afu, *ifa, *ifi, *ifu, *ufa, *ufi, *ufu, *asa, *asi, *asu, *isa, *isi, *isu, *usa, *usi, *usu}. This is a negative 3-gram grammar because each of the forbidden n-grams is a 3-gram, and we are listing out which combinations are not allowed, rather than which combinations are permitted. These are all the forbidden combinations because they each have a voiceless sound (s, f) between two vowels, and this is forbidden by the principle of intervocalic voicing.
- The negative 2-gram grammar that describes local assimilation for this set of sounds is {*np, *nb}. This is a negative 2-gram grammar because each of the forbidden n-grams is a 2-gram that is disallowed by the rule, rather than allowed. These are all the forbidden combinations because they have a nasal with a different place of articulation than the stop which follows.
- The negative 3-gram grammar that describes local dissimilation for this set of sounds is {*rar, *rir, *rur}. This is a negative 3-gram grammar because each of the forbidden n-grams is a 3-gram, and we are listing out which combinations are not allowed, rather than which combinations are permitted. These are all the forbidden 3-grams because they each have the same sound occuring with a vowel in between, and by the dissimilation rule, this cannot occur.
- The negative 3-gram grammar that describes this phenomenon is {*$\sigma \sigma${{{R}}}, *[stressed][stressed]{{{R}}}, *$\sigma$[stressed]{{{R}}}}. This is a negative 3-gram grammar because each of the n-grams in it is a 3-gram, and we are specifying which ones are not permitted, rather than the ones that are.
