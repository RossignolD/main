    "==========================\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have a simple model of phonotactics according to which the\n",
    "phonotactic well-formedness can be determined from the chunks that it is\n",
    "built from. In a trigram model, for instance, a word is ill-formed iff\n",
    "it contains one or more illicit trigrams. We formalize this in terms of\n",
    "a negative $n$-gram grammar, which is a finite set of illicit $n$-grams.\n",
    "So far, the models looks rather promising as it can handle a variety of\n",
    "phenomena: word-final devoicing, intervocalic voicing, local\n",
    "assimilation, and various stress rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the model seems to work well for phonotactics, it is tempting to\n",
    "expand it to other domains. But as we will see next, this reveals\n",
    "certain shortcomings of the negative grammar format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Morphotactics\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like phonotactics regulates the linear order of sounds in a word,\n",
    "**morphotactics** regulates the linear order of morphemes. Morphemes\n",
    "consist of multiple sounds and are the building blocks of words. For\n",
    "example, *denaturalization* is built from the morphemes *de-*, *nature*,\n",
    "*-al*, *-ize*, and *-ation*. Morphemes cannot be combined willy-nilly,\n",
    "they have to follow a specific order. In the case of *denaturalization*,\n",
    "no other order is possible. Even though the word is built up from 5\n",
    "elements, which could be arranged in\n",
    "$5! = 5 \\mult 4 \\mult 3 \\mult 2 \\mult 1 = 120$ distinct ways, only one\n",
    "of them is actually allowed by English. So morphotactics defines a very\n",
    "tight rule system for how elements may be ordered in a word, much\n",
    "tighter than phonotactics, where individual sounds have more leeway as\n",
    "to where they occur in a word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see if we can write a negative $n$-gram grammar that allows for\n",
    "*denaturalization* but forbids all illicit orders,\n",
    "e.g. *naturedeationizal*. First, we have to pick the basing building\n",
    "blocks for the $n$-grams. For phonotactics, we used $n$-grams where each\n",
    "symbol is a sound, but this is too fine-grained for morphotactics.\n",
    "Instead, we will use $n$-grams where each symbol is a morpheme. So *-ize\n",
    "-ation* is a bigram, not a 6-gram (or 11-gram if one counts characters\n",
    "instead of sounds).\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "chunk = \"-ize -ation\"\n",
    "print(\"{} with characters as symbols: {}-gram\".format(chunk, len(chunk)))\n",
    "print(\"{} with sounds as symbols: {}-gram\".format(chunk, len(\"izaSon\")))\n",
    "print(\"{} with morphemes as symbols: {}-gram\".format(chunk, len((\"-ize\", \"-ation\"))))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With each morpheme as a separate symbol, it should be straight-forward\n",
    "to design a negative grammar to generate *de-nature-al-ize-ation* but\n",
    "none of the other orders. Let’s first write down the conditions in plain\n",
    "English:\n",

    "In positive $n$-gram grammars, all $n$-grams must be of the same length\n",

    "-------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have two different kinds of $n$-gram grammars: positive grammars,\n",

    "sense that one can freely translate between the two. The same is in fact\n",
