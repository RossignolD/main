# From Automata to Transducers

This unit was mostly discussed in class, so I'll leave the writing for a later point.
The following topics were covered:

1. Transducers as automata with complex edge labels
1. Regular languages are closed under FSTs
1. FSTs are not closed under intersection
1. FSTs are closed under composition
1. Connection between FSTs and SPE
1. Implications for phonology
